# Two GameMaker Studio Walk Throughs

## Introduction
There are two folders with two GameMaker studio walk throughs. The first **Space Rocks - GML Tutorial** is the free tutorial available at [YoYo Games Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/7423/space-rocks-gml).  This beginner tutorial teaches you how to make a simplified version of Asteroids.  It uses GameMaker's GML programming language.

The second tutorial is a follow up and can be found in the **GMS2-ExtendedSpaceRocks** folder.  It is a follow up that I wrote that takes it a little bit further.  It still leaves lots of room to add a completed game.  It is meant as a starting point and not a finished game.  I expect you to finish the level design and add any functionality you please.

In this tutorial:

* Importing assets from other projects
* Add variables and comments to all scripts without changing functionality
* Resize ship 
* Add flame behind ship when accelerating
* Add ship explosion animation
* Change player death and end game timing
* Add friction and maximum speed
* Use timeline for spawning rocks and add custom spawning script
* Trigger waves either by time or by score

## Controls
* Left and Right arrow rotate the ship
* Up arrow accelerates
* Space bar shoots
* Enter starts game
