This proccess was difficult even though I clawed out work time into my schedule
- It takes me a minute to catch on, but I'm starting to get it my brain proccessor takes its time
I made major time to attempt to finish the first tutorial but came up short
- was missing a ob_debris FIXED
- I put in the wrong language on multiple occasions and clawing my hair out trying to figure it out
- I just finally breathe and went back to the tutorial, stop rushing and read it properly and now my game works (not blank anymore) 
- Had to organize my rooms properly along with getting rid of syntax errors
- I read some parts of the mamual so that I can understand the terminology including the info thats on moodle you posted
- Now I just need to catch up by Sat hopefully by the evening or late evening 
- I will keep intouch with emails/communication
