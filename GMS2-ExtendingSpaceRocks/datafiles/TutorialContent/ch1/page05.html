	<b>Add Friction and Max Speed</b>

	<p>
		Open <tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event script and lets get rid of spawning rocks to test the ship on its own.  Change the <tt><b>repeat()</b></tt> to <tt><b>0</b></tt> and comment out <tt><b>alarm[o] = 60;</b></tt>

		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/RemoveRocksToTestShipFrict.png" alt="Remove alarm for spawning rocks to test">
		
	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt> in the top menu bar to launch the game.  Fly the plane by holding the up arrow.  You will notice that it accelerates endlessly and never slows down when you let go of the acceleration button.
		
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/EndlessSpeedNoFriction.gif" alt="Run game and see that plane accelerates endlessly">

	<p>
		Now we will be adding two things to the physics of the game.  We will be adding friction and clamping the maximum speed.  So I tried using the variable name <tt><b>friction</b></tt> but it turns green and is recognized as a built-in variable. We will not use their internal friction implementation so instead create a variable called <tt><b>ship_friction</b></tt>.  Open <tt><b>obj_ship: Create</b></tt> event script:
		<h3><tt><b>obj_ship: Create</b></tt> Event </h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/FrictionProtected.png" alt="Add ship_friction variable">

	<p>
		Since we are subtracting .01 each frame to friction we need to add this to the acceleration to compensate (otherwise the ship will accelerate more slowly).  We don't want to negatively change our gameplay. So we change <tt><b>acceleration</b></tt> from <tt><b>.05</b></tt> to <tt><b>.06</b></tt>. 
	
	<p>
		We don't want the ship to move faster than its bullets.  The bullet speed is 6 so we will set a <tt><b>max_speed</b></tt> of <tt><b>4</b></tt>.  Add below the <tt><b>ship_friction</b></tt> variable.

		<h3><tt><b>obj_ship: Create</b></tt> Event </h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SetMaxSpeedShipCreate.png" alt="Add max_speed variable">

	<p>
		Open the <tt><b>obj_ship: Step</b></tt> event and lets add friction just before the <tt><b>move_wrap()</b></tt> function.  Friction is simple, each frame we will sap some speed from the overall speed.  We just subtract each frame the friction amount (which is smaller than acceleration).

		<h3><tt><b>obj_ship: Step</b></tt> Event </h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/AddFrictionToShip.png" alt="Add friction to obj_ship step event">

	<p>
		Now the problem with the above friction is that it could go below zero.  It could go negative so the ship if you are not accelerating with stop then start to move backwards. 

	<p>
		We can solve this problem and deal with the max speed with a single function. <b><a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowHelp?tag=clamp">clamp(val, min, max)</a></b>.  This constrains the variable passed to the <tt><b>val</b></tt> argument will return a number that is between the min and max argument.

	<p> 
	
		We then take the return value and put it back in the <tt><b>speed</b></tt> variable that effectively clamps that variable to never go outside the prescribed max and min parameter.  So we have a minimum speed of 0 and maximum speed of <tt><b>max_speed</b></tt> (set to 4).
		<h3><tt><b>obj_ship: Step</b></tt> Event </h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/ClampSpeedsShip.png" alt="Set max speed in clamp">	

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt> in the top menu bar to launch the game.  Fly the plane by holding the up arrow.  You will now have a max speed.  Let also make sure that it slows to a halt and that friction works.  Feel free to play with these default values to try and change the game experience to your liking.

	<p> 
		Now we are going to change how we launch rocks.  Currently the model launches rocks with random placement and random directions.  This means that we will not be able to learn how to beat the game as each time we play it the game will be different (if the random seed is properly updated which is beyond the scope of this tutorial).  

	<p>
		We will also take some of the math out of positioning the rocks.  I have provided a function with this tutorial that will take the difficult part out of this task.  You can find it in the <tt><b>Tutorial Resources | scr_spawn_asteroid</b></tt> folder.  If you can't find it you should be able to access it through <a href="gms2tutorials:///ShowFiles?path=../TutorialResources/scr_spawn_asteroid">here</a>.

	<p>
		Right click on <tt><b>Scripts</b></tt> and select <tt><b>Add Existing</b></tt> from the drop down menu:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/AddExistingScript.png" alt="Add scr_spawn_asteroid script">

	<p>
		Now select the file called <tt><b>scr_spawn_asteroid.yy</b></tt> in the <tt><b>Included Files | TutorialResources</b></tt> folder (or the location through the above link).

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SelectScrSpawnAsteroidScript.png" alt="Select the scr_spawn_asteroid">	
		
	<p>
		<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_LMB.png" alt="Left mouse button illustration"> Double click to open <tt><b>scr_spawn_asteroid</b></tt> in the <tt><b>Script</b></tt> folder.  You can read through the script if you like.  

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SpawnAsteroidScript.png" alt="Look at scr_spawn_asteroid script">	

	<p>
		This function is used to spawn new rocks and it does a few things that help us design and shape gameplay:

		<ul>
		<li>The function does not return any value</li>
		<li>It assumes you have three sprites called <tt><b>spr_asteroid_small</b></tt>, <tt><b>spr_asteroid_med</b></tt> and <tt><b>spr_asteroid_huge.</b></tt></li>  It will <b>not</b> work unless your sprites are named exactly the same.
		<tt>It assumes you have a variable called <tt><b>half_sprite_width</b></tt>
		<li>The function has 5 arguments you need to pass to it</li>
			<ul>
				<li><tt><b>asteroid_sprite</b></tt> is the name of one of the three asteroid sprites</li>
				<li><tt><b>x_pos</b></tt> is a normalised value (between 0 and 1) that goes from off screen left to off screen right</li>
				<li><tt><b>y_pos</b></tt> is a normalised value (between 0 and 1) that goes from off screen top to off screen bottom</li>
				<li><tt><b>speed_multiplier</b></tt> that multiplies the base speed of (4 pixels per second for the small rock, 2 for the medium rock, and 1 for the large rock) from huge to small asteroid.  A value of 1 will not change the default speed.</li>
				<li><tt><b>angle</b></tt> is the angle in degrees that the rock moves in</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<p>
		This function ensures that the asteroid starts off screen.  It will not spawn it if the value of <tt><b>x_pos</b></tt> or <tt><b>y_pos</b></tt> is not either 0 or 1.  Let me show you in a diagram:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/XposYPosExample.png" alt="Diagram of rock positioning">	
		
	<p>
		For the astroid to be offscreen x_pos needs to be 0 or 1 or y_pos needs to be 0 or 1. Lets look at an example if we call:
	
	<p class = "code">
		scr_spawn_asteroid(spr_asteroid_small, 0, 0, 1, -30);

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/FirstRockSpawn.png" alt="Diagram of where rock will spawn and in what direction">	

	<p>
		Reopen <tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event and delete all old spawning as we will call our newly imported function instead.
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> Event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/RemoveOldWayOfSpawning.png" alt="Delete spawning in obj_game Room Start event">	
		
	<p>
		Replace the old way of spawning by calling this new function with the same parameters we showed in the above example. It should start in the top left corner of the screen then bo -30 degrees downward and miss the player in the center by passing on top of him (so you don't get killed by the first rock).
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> Event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/CallSpawnAsteroidFunction.png" alt="Call new spawning script">	

	<p>
		If you mispell the name of the asteroid sprite (or if your spelling is different) you will get a run time error like below:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/MIspellRock.png" alt="Error for mispelled rock">	
		
	<p>
		If you try and spawn a rock without placing it outside the room you will get an error message in the output window that states: 

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/WillNotSpawnInGameWindow.png" alt="Error for misplacing rock inside room to start">	

<p>
	Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt> in the top menu bar to launch the game.  Notice that the rock flies past pretty fast.  But lets make it go faster.
	
<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/NewRockLaunching.gif" alt="Run game and see new spawning hurl rock">

	<p>
		The speed multiplier adjusts the speed.  To make the small rock go twice as fast we will change the speed_multiplier to <tt><b>2</b></tt>:
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> Event</h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SpeedScalar2.png" alt="Change speed multiplier to 2">	

	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt> in the top menu bar to launch the game.  Notice that the rock flies past twice as fast. 
	
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/DoubleSpeedSmallRock.gif" alt="Run game and see rock flying twice as fast">

	<p>
		Now open <tt><b>obj_bullet: Collision</b></tt> event with <tt><b>obj_asteroid</b></tt> and lets use the same rule we used in the new spawner.  Each smaller rock moves twice as fast as its larger size.  So when we spawn the two smaller rocks we double the speed.

		<h3><tt><b>obj_bullet: Collision</b></tt> Event</h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH2/AdjustSpeedWhenSpawningSmallerAsteroids.png" alt="Fix spawning in rock killing script in obj_bullet: Collision event">	

	<p>
		The other thing I don't like in this script is that the direction those rocks go in is entirely random.  I would rather have them splay out in a predictable way.  We will have them go 50 and -50 degrees away from their original root.  We use a temporary variable <tt><b>i</b></tt> which in the first pass is positive and the second pass is negative and will change the angle from positive to negative:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/FlayOutNewRocks.png" alt="Splay rocks out at 50 and -50 degrees when hit">	

	<p> 
		The other thing about the original game is that you scored more points for destroying smaller rocks.  So lets add three levels to the score. Start by deleting the current score increase at the top of the <tt><b>obj_bullet: Collision</b></tt> event and moving it to where we check for which rock we have collided with. So destroying a huge rock gets 10 points, medium gets 20 and we need to add an <tt><b>else</b></tt> statement and add 50 points for a small rock.

		<div class = "note">
		<p> Please note: We are using += as an abbreviated way of expression what we want to do with this variable. It is an operator where:
		<h3>score = score + 50;</h3> 
		<p>is the same as 
		<h3>score += 50;</h3>
		</div>
	<h3><tt><b>obj_bullet: Collision</b></tt> Event</h3>
	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/3DifferentScores.png" alt="Change points for three rocks">	
		

	<p>
		The next item that we want to look at is restarting the game when dying.  In the original arcade game it continued and you kept your score.  Open <tt><b>obj_game</b></tt> event <tt><b>Alarm1</b></tt> and comment out restarting the game and instead respawn the ship in the middle of the screen:
		<h3><tt><b>obj_game</b></tt> event <tt><b>Alarm1</b></tt> Event</h3>

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/RespawnShip.png" alt="Don't restart game when dying and get points instead">	

	<p>
		When making changes it is super important to test your work. You do not want to introduce an unknown bug.  Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>. If you play the entire game we see that we get an error message when we get killed the third time:

	<p>
		<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SpawnsRestartedShipInEndGame.png" alt="Error message for dying a thrid time">			

	<p>
		The <tt><b>obj_game</b></tt> is respawning another ship into the end level.  It is looking for the flame object and cannot find it. We can fix it by putting a check when updating the flame but we don't want to spawn in this room.  Instead we will edit the <tt><b>obj_game: Alarm1</b></tt> event and make sure we are in the game room before we respawn the ship.
     <h3><tt><b>obj_game: Alarm1</b></tt> event</h3>
<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/CheckIfRoomExistsRespawn.png" alt="obj_game alarm1 event make sure we are in a game room">						

<p>
	Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt>.Test the level again by dying three times, and this should fix the bug.

<p>
	For testing lets go back to <tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt> event and add two more rocks and make them huge so we have more targets to shoot at.

<h3><tt><b>obj_game: Room Start</b></tt></h3>
<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Extending-Space-Rocks/CH1/SpawnMoreRocks.png" alt="Add two more rocks spawning to room start in obj_game">				
		
	<p>
		Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="Play button"> <tt><b>Play Button</b></tt> in the top menu bar to launch the game.  The game doesn't restart each time you die, the rocks flay out nicely and the game is now predictable, it will run the same way everytime so you can learn to improve by replaying the game. This is the magic of not using random positions! Next up we will give you the option of two ways of spawning asteroids.
